# MyofibrilJ

**MyofibrilJ** is a set of routines to analyse fibril morphology in fluorescence images of muscle fibers. They are provided as a plugin for [ImageJ](http://imagej.net/).

Descriptions of the routines and installation instructions are available at the [MyofibrilJ update site](http://imagej.net/MyofibrilJ).



## Routines
Routines currently implemented:

1. **Analyze myofibril lengthwise**: estimate the average sarcomere length and the average thickness of the fibrils 
1. **Analyze myofibril crosswise**: estimate the average diameter of the fibrils and their degree of clustering
